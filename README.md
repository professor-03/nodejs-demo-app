Steps i followed to do this project :
- i prefer creating an ec2 instance for doing all the tasks and so did i do here
- then i created the required directory in the following order i.e nodejs-demo-app/.github/workflows
- and i did all other changes and the root directory  is workflows/
- note: .github is a hidden directory  so anyone viewing it must use "ls -a" command
- wrote a yaml file by taking reference from copilot and made the required changes
- created a dockerfile and pulled a simple calculator image
- various other files that were created for the ci/cd pipeline to function are: .json file , test-- file

  So this was a brief summary about the tasks i performed in the above project!!

                                                                signing off !!
